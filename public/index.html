      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my Three.js playground!</p>
      <p>Let's cover a quick introduction of how this playground works, then we can look at the basics of Three.js:</p>
      <h3>Code / Project Structure</h3>
      <p>Each example from the previous menu lives in <em>public/scripts/examples</em> and is loaded as a module using <a href="http://requirejs.org">RequireJS</a>. The core setup and rendering code is initialized in <em>public/scripts/main.js</em> and passed to each example's constructor. I'd encourage you to open up these parts in your editor so you can take a peek at what's going on as we step through each part of Three.js.</p>
      <p class="warning">NOTE: The goal of this project is to provide a Three.js playground with examples of each piece of functionality that makes learning and understanding the library as easy as possible. This hack-job of a sandbox is atypical of any and all best practices; however, I've structured it in a way that makes viewing Three.js examples in isolation easy and clear as possible. Reccomendations and contributions are welcome on <a href="http://github.com/nicovalencia/three.js-playground" target="_BLANK">GitHub</a>.</p>
